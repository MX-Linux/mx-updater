Inside apt-notifer we now use ngettext to correctly translate the 
plural forms. Please add the xgettext mode -cTAG/--add-comments=TAG with 
TAG as "TRANSLATORS:".

An example is included in the make-pot.sh script. The -cTAG option 
ensures that comments which are available in the Python scripts are 
available in transifex, so that the translator can use the comments to 
fill in all plural forms for their respective languages. The 
apt-notifier.pot file is created by running make-pot.sh from this 
directory.
